                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>
                    InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, is an evangelical and 
                    interdenominational campus ministry. InterVarsity is active on 
                    more than 600 college and university campuses nationwide and Bruin
                    Christian Fellowship is the UCLA chapter of InterVarsity.


                    InterVarsity—meaning between universities—traces its roots to a 
                    movement of British university students in the 1870s. The first 
                    InterVarsity chapter in the United States began in 1938 at the 
                    University of Michigan. Since InterVarsity was incorporated in 1941,
                    thousands of students have become thoughtful representatives of God’s
                    kingdom and have moved into leadership roles in churches, organizations,
                    corporations and agencies around the world.

                <h3>What We Do</h3>
                <p>
                        InterVarsity Bruin Christian Fellowship is becoming an authentic
                        community of witnesses led by the Holy Spirit to bring God’s love
                        to every corner of UCLA. In short, we are a multi-ethnic community
                        of students who are seeking to know the full life that Jesus offers.
                        We offer small group communities throughout the dorms and apartments
                        where we study the life of Jesus and the purposes of God, and challenge
                        one another to put our faith into action.

                <h3>What We Believe In</h3>
                <p>
                    The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things,
                    existing eternally in three persons–
                    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit–full of love and glory.
                    
                    
                    The unique divine inspiration,
                    entire trustworthiness
                    and authority of the Bible.
                    
                    
                    The value and dignity of all people:
                    created in God’s image to live in love and holiness,
                    but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt,
                    and justly subject to God’s wrath.
                    
                    
                    Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine,
                    who lived as a perfect example,
                    who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place,
                    and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.
                    
                    
                    Justification by God’s grace to all who repent
                    and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.
                    
                    
                    The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit,
                    who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.
                    
                    
                    The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ,
                    manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches
                    making disciples throughout the world.
                    
                    
                    The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ,
                    who will judge all people with justice and mercy,
                    giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation
                    but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.
                    
                    
                    To God be glory forever.
